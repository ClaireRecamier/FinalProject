USER MANUAL

Hello User! Welcome to my Cs50 Final Project, WikiExtractor.
Find my code on Github at https://github.com/ClaireRecamier/FinalProject

I wrote this code using the source code for the finance pset from the web development track. As a result, it uses Jinja, Flask, python,
and the Cs50 libraries, and I don't think it would work as of now on any other IDE :(

In terminal, CD into the directory on your Cs50IDE in which the project is contained. Once you're in the right directory, type flask run.
You should see "serving flask app application.py lazy loading" "environment:developer" "debug mode off" "running on" etc. After "running on"
there should be a link, followed by "Press CTRL+C to quit". Click that link and then click open.

This should bring you to the main page of the web app.
